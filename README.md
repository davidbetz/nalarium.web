## Web-related areas of Nalarium

Nalarium.Web (and some other parts): A lot of stuff just to smooth over web-related functionality. Because the web isn't... just web... and more (e.g. URLs aren't considered to be owned by the web), some stuff actually got promoted to [Nalarium.dll](https://github.com/davidbetz/nalarium) (e.g. Url). A lot of stuff is historical, including my own version of WebAPI before Microsoft released theirs. Localization plays an important role in all page related things.
